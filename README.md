## 🚀 Overview

This project implements a **real-time gesture-controlled gaming interface** using **computer vision and human–computer interaction (HCI)** principles.

Hand gestures captured through a webcam are processed live and translated into **system-level keyboard inputs**, enabling **hands-free control of a game** running inside an Android emulator.

The goal was not just gesture detection, but building a **robust end-to-end interaction pipeline** that connects vision, decision logic, and OS-level control in real time.

🚀 Getting Started
1️⃣ Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/gesture-controlled-game-interface.git
cd gesture-controlled-game-interface
2️⃣ Create Virtual Environment
bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\Activate   # Windows
3️⃣ Install Dependencies
bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
4️⃣ Run the Project
bash
Copy code
python gesture_control_hill_climb.py
⚠️ Make sure the game/emulator window is in focus while running the script.

🧪 Gesture Mapping (Current)
Gesture	Action
✊ Fist	Move Left
🖐 Open Palm	Move Right
Other / No Hand	Neutral

🧩 Challenges & Learnings
Managing real-time latency in vision pipelines

Handling gesture noise and lighting variability

Debugging Python version & dependency conflicts

Understanding limitations of deployability for hardware-dependent CV systems

Designing intuitive human–machine interaction loops

This project reinforced that debugging and integration are where real learning happens.

🔮 Future Enhancements
